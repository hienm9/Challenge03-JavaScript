# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator
Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, which ensures that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

In this challenge, the HTML and CSS files are given. The JS file also has some starter code.
In the Javascript file, I added following:
   create variable string to hold characters
   create generatePassword function to get randome element from the string that has all answers
   create password options function to prompt user to select each option.
Use the random function to generate random password from the string that has all answers.

The code seem to work ok. I think there is still one small thing I need to update to the cancel button at the beginning.
